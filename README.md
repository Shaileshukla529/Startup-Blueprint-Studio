# Startup Blueprint Generator

## Overview

Welcome to the **Startup Blueprint Generator**, a sophisticated AI-powered agent designed to transform a simple startup idea into a comprehensive, actionable business blueprint. This tool acts as a virtual business consultant, guiding aspiring entrepreneurs through the critical early stages of planning and strategy development. By leveraging a rich knowledge base and structured analytical frameworks, the agent helps users build a solid foundation for their ventures.

## Core Features

The Startup Blueprint Generator provides a detailed analysis and generates a multi-faceted business plan covering four essential pillars:

1.  **Business Model Canvas**: A complete breakdown of the 9 building blocks of the business model, tailored to the user's specific idea. This includes value proposition, customer segments, revenue streams, and more.
2.  **Financial Blueprint**: A detailed 12-18 month financial plan, including budget allocations, cost projections, and key financial metrics to track for success.
3.  **Go-to-Market Strategy**: A phased strategy for market entry, customer acquisition, and scaling. It includes competitor analysis and recommendations for marketing channels.
4.  **Regulatory & Legal Guidance**: A roadmap for navigating the legal landscape, including recommendations on business structure, compliance requirements, and intellectual property.

## How It Works

The agent follows a systematic and consultative process to build the blueprint:

1.  **Information Gathering**: The agent starts by asking a series of probing questions to deeply understand the user's startup idea, target market, and goals.
2.  **Data Retrieval**: It then queries its knowledge base, which includes government policies, investor advice, and market research, to find relevant information.
3.  **Blueprint Generation**: Using the gathered information and retrieved data, the agent populates a series of structured templates to generate the final, comprehensive business blueprint.
4.  **Actionable Next Steps**: The final output includes a prioritized list of actions for the next 30, 90, and 180 days to help founders get started immediately.

## Knowledge Base

The agent's insights are powered by a curated set of documents, ensuring the advice is relevant and practical. The knowledge base includes:

*   **Government Schemes**: Information on programs like Startup India, including eligibility and application processes.
*   **Investor Advice**: Wisdom from seasoned investors on what makes a startup successful, how to find product-market fit, and how to prepare for funding rounds.
*   **Market Research**: Data and trends on specific industries, with an initial focus on the IT sector in India.
